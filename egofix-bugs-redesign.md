# EgoFix — Bug & Fix Redesign

## What's Wrong With the Current Bugs

### Overlap problems
- **"Need to be right"** and **"Need to control"** share the same root: asserting dominance to feel safe. A fix like "Let someone do it their way" could belong to either.
- **"Need to compare"** is a behavior that shows up inside other patterns (comparing achievements = need to impress, comparing approval = need to be liked) rather than being its own root.
- **"Need to avoid failure"** is more about anxiety than ego. It's closer to perfectionism/fear, which isn't really an ego pattern — it's a defense mechanism.

### Missing patterns
- Nothing about **performing/signaling** (name-dropping, virtue signaling, performing expertise)
- Nothing about **deflection** (using humor, intellectualizing, changing subjects to avoid being seen)
- Nothing about **complaining/victimhood** (one of the most common ego patterns per Tolle, Freud, and CBT research)
- Nothing about **identity attachment** (I am my job, my opinions, my taste)

### Fix repetition
With only 5 bugs and limited interaction types, fixes start to blur together. "Don't correct someone" and "Let someone have the last word" are essentially the same challenge wearing different clothes.

---

## The Redesigned Bugs

Seven bugs. Each represents a distinct ego strategy — a different way the mind protects its sense of self. Minimal overlap, distinct fix spaces, psychologically grounded.

Users pick 1–3 to focus on. The app never shows all 7 at once during onboarding (overwhelming). Instead: show 5 most common, with "show more" for the remaining 2.

### 1. The Corrector
**Slug:** `need-to-be-right`
**Title:** Need to be right
**Description:** Correcting others, winning arguments, having the last word. The inability to let an error — especially someone else's — go unchallenged.
**Root mechanism:** Equating being right with being worthy. If I'm wrong, I'm diminished.
**Color:** Red/orange (warning/error)

**What it looks like in daily life:**
- Interrupting to correct a minor factual error
- Replaying arguments in your head and "winning" them
- Feeling physical discomfort when someone says something incorrect
- Needing to have the last word in a text thread
- Correcting someone's grammar or pronunciation

---

### 2. The Performer
**Slug:** `need-to-impress`
**Title:** Need to impress
**Description:** Steering conversations toward your achievements, expertise, or status. Performing a version of yourself that will be admired.
**Root mechanism:** Equating achievement with identity. If they don't know what I've done, I don't exist.
**Color:** Purple/indigo (prestige)

**What it looks like in daily life:**
- Name-dropping (people, companies, places)
- Steering conversations to your area of expertise
- Mentioning your job title, school, or salary unprompted
- Humble-bragging ("I'm so exhausted from all my meetings")
- Checking how many likes/reactions your post got

---

### 3. The Chameleon
**Slug:** `need-to-be-liked`
**Title:** Need to be liked
**Description:** Adjusting your opinions, tone, and behavior to match what you think others want. Performing agreeability at the cost of authenticity.
**Root mechanism:** Equating approval with safety. If they don't like me, I'm in danger.
**Color:** Cyan/teal (shape-shifting, fluid)

**What it looks like in daily life:**
- Saying "yes" when you mean "no"
- Laughing at jokes you don't find funny
- Changing your opinion mid-conversation to match the room
- Over-apologizing
- Not sharing your actual preference ("I'm easy, you choose")

---

### 4. The Controller
**Slug:** `need-to-control`
**Title:** Need to control
**Description:** Micromanaging, difficulty letting others do things their way, anxiety when plans change. A compulsive grip on outcomes.
**Root mechanism:** Equating control with security. If I'm not directing it, it will go wrong (and that reflects on me).
**Color:** Yellow/amber (caution, alert)

**What it looks like in daily life:**
- Redoing someone else's work because it wasn't done "right"
- Giving unsolicited instructions
- Anxiety when plans change last-minute
- Difficulty delegating without hovering
- Planning every detail of a trip/event and getting upset when it deviates

---

### 5. The Scorekeeper
**Slug:** `need-to-compare`
**Title:** Need to compare
**Description:** Measuring yourself against others. Needing to know where you rank. Feeling threatened by others' success or validated by their failure.
**Root mechanism:** Equating rank with value. I'm only okay if I'm ahead.
**Color:** Green (competitive, envious)

**What it looks like in daily life:**
- Checking what peers/colleagues earn, own, or achieved
- Feeling a pang when a friend succeeds at something you care about
- One-upping stories ("That's cool, but I once...")
- Mentally ranking yourself in every room you enter
- Scrolling social media and measuring your life against others'

---

### 6. The Deflector
**Slug:** `need-to-deflect`
**Title:** Need to deflect
**Description:** Using humor, intellect, or subject changes to avoid being truly seen. Keeping people at arm's length while appearing open.
**Root mechanism:** Equating vulnerability with weakness. If they see the real me, they'll have power over me.
**Color:** Gray/silver (smoke screen, evasion)

**What it looks like in daily life:**
- Making a joke when a conversation gets serious
- Answering "how are you?" with performance instead of truth
- Intellectualizing emotions ("I think what's happening is...")
- Changing the subject when it gets personal
- Never asking for help, even when drowning

---

### 7. The Narrator
**Slug:** `need-to-narrate`
**Title:** Need to narrate
**Description:** Constructing and rehearsing stories about yourself — especially stories of being wronged, unappreciated, or uniquely burdened. Complaining as identity.
**Root mechanism:** Equating suffering with significance. My story IS me. Without my grievances, who am I?
**Color:** Blue/dark blue (melancholy, depth)

**What it looks like in daily life:**
- Rehearsing arguments or grievances in your head
- Telling the same complaint story to multiple people
- Finding fault in situations before finding anything good
- "You won't believe what happened to me" as a conversation opener
- Internally narrating your day as if documenting injustices

---

## Interaction Types (Expanded)

Beyond the existing 6 types, here are additional interaction patterns that create variety and match different kinds of ego work:

### Existing types
| Type | Description | Best for |
|------|-------------|----------|
| `standard` | Simple prompt — go do this | Behavioral challenges |
| `timed` | Timer must complete (sit with a feeling, wait before responding) | Impulse control, stillness |
| `multiStep` | Sequential steps to follow | Complex social experiments |
| `quiz` | Multiple choice self-assessment | Self-awareness checks |
| `scenario` | Read a situation, choose your response | Pattern recognition |
| `counter` | Track how many times something happens | Awareness building |

### New types to add

| Type | Description | Best for | Example |
|------|-------------|----------|---------|
| `observation` | Notice something specific, report back what you saw | Building awareness without changing behavior yet | "Count how many times you start a sentence with 'I' today" |
| `abstain` | Go a defined period WITHOUT doing something | Breaking automatic behaviors | "Go until noon without giving advice" |
| `substitute` | When urge X arises, do Y instead | Replacing patterns | "When you want to correct someone, ask them a question instead" |
| `journal` | Short text prompt — write 2-3 sentences | Deeper reflection | "Describe the last time you changed your opinion to match the room" |
| `reversal` | Do the opposite of your default | Experiencing the unfamiliar | "In your next meeting, speak last instead of first" |
| `predict` | Predict what will happen, then observe what actually does | Testing ego's assumptions | "Predict how people will react if you say 'I don't know.' Then try it." |
| `body` | Notice a physical sensation tied to an ego moment | Somatic awareness | "Next time you feel the urge to correct someone, notice where you feel it in your body" |
| `audit` | End-of-day review of specific behaviors | Pattern recognition | "Tonight, list 3 moments where you performed instead of being genuine" |

## Fix Examples by Bug

### 1. NEED TO BE RIGHT (The Corrector)

**Standard:**
- Let someone else have the last word today. `// This is harder when you're sure you're right. That's the point.`
- Someone will say something incorrect today. Let it stand. `// The world won't end. Check tomorrow.`
- In your next disagreement, say "You might be right" — and mean it.
- When you feel the urge to reply-all with a correction, close the email instead.
- Let someone mispronounce a word today without correcting them. `// Your discomfort is the data.`

**Counter:**
- Count how many times today you feel the urge to correct someone. Don't act on it — just count. `// The number is the insight, not the fix.`
- Track how many statements you make today that start with "Actually..." or "Well, technically..."

**Timed:**
- The next time you're in a disagreement, wait 30 seconds before responding. `// Notice what happens in that silence.`
- Sit with being wrong about something for 5 minutes. Don't explain, defend, or revisit it.
- After someone corrects YOU today, wait 2 minutes before responding. Just breathe.

**Observation:**
- Notice: when someone corrects you, what's the first emotion? Not the second one (the rational one). The first flash.
- Pay attention to who you correct most. Is it the same person? `// That's not about accuracy. That's about something else.`

**Scenario:**
- *Your friend confidently states a "fact" you know is wrong. Others are nodding along.* → Options: Correct them publicly / Let it go / Bring it up privately later / Ask a question that lets them self-correct `// Each choice reveals something different about what you need.`
- *A coworker gives a presentation with a minor error on slide 3. Nobody else seems to notice.* → Options: Mention it after / Let it go / Slack them privately / Bring it up in front of everyone

**Quiz:**
- When someone corrects you, your gut reaction is usually: (a) Defend your position immediately (b) Accept it outwardly but replay it later (c) Feel a flash of anger (d) Genuinely consider their point `// There's no right answer. But be honest about which one comes first.`

**Journal:**
- Write about the last argument you "won." What did winning actually give you?
- Describe a time you were wrong about something important. How long did it take you to admit it?

**Predict:**
- Predict: if you let one wrong thing go uncorrected today, what do you think will happen? Try it, then compare.

**Reversal:**
- Ask someone for their opinion on something you consider yourself an expert in. Listen without correcting. `// This will feel wrong. That's interesting, isn't it?`

**Substitute:**
- Every time you want to correct someone today, ask them a question instead. `// "What makes you think that?" teaches you more than "Actually, that's wrong."`

**Body:**
- Next time you suppress a correction, scan your body. Where does the tension live? Jaw? Chest? Hands?

**Abstain:**
- Go the entire workday without correcting anyone — in person, in chat, in email. Zero corrections until 6pm.

---

### 2. NEED TO IMPRESS (The Performer)

**Standard:**
- Go an entire conversation without mentioning your work.
- The next time someone asks "what do you do?", give the shortest possible answer. Don't elaborate.

**Counter:**
- Count how many times today you steer a conversation toward yourself or your achievements.
- Track how many times you check for likes/reactions/views on something you posted.

**Timed:**
- After posting something on social media, don't check the engagement for 4 hours.

**Observation:**
- Notice: in your next group conversation, who talks about themselves the most? (It might be you.)
- Pay attention to what triggers name-dropping. Is it when you feel outranked?

**Abstain:**
- Go until dinner without mentioning your job title, company, school, or any credential.
- One full day without humble-bragging. Not even the subtle kind. `// "I'm so tired" after a big meeting counts.`

- Describe a time you felt valued for who you are, not what you've done.

**Scenario:**
- *At a dinner party, someone asks the table to share something interesting about themselves.* → Options: Share an achievement / Share a hobby / Share something embarrassing / Say "I'm still figuring that out" `// Notice which option scares you.`

**Quiz:**
- When you meet someone new, within the first 5 minutes you usually: (a) Mention what you do for work (b) Ask about them first (c) Find a way to mention something impressive (d) Keep it light and surface-level

**Reversal:**
- In your next conversation, ask three questions about the other person before saying anything about yourself.

---

### 3. NEED TO BE LIKED (The Chameleon)

- Track how many times you adjust your opinion to match whoever you're talking to.

**Timed:**
- The next time someone asks you a question, wait 5 seconds before answering. Use those seconds to check: is your answer true, or is it what they want to hear?
- Sit for 3 minutes with this: "What would I do differently if I wasn't worried about what people think?"

**Observation:**
- Notice: does your sense of humor change depending on who you're with? `// Which version is real?`
- Pay attention to how you describe yourself differently to different people.

**Journal:**
- Write about something you pretended to like this week to fit in. Why?
- What's an opinion you hold that you've never said out loud?

- Don't apologize for anything today unless you caused actual harm.

**Scenario:**
- *Your friend group is planning something you genuinely don't want to do.* → Options: Go anyway and pretend / Say you can't make it (white lie) / Say you're not into it honestly / Suggest an alternative `// Notice which option feels impossible.`

**Reversal:**
- When someone shares an opinion today, share yours — even if it contradicts theirs. `// Not to fight. Just to exist authentically for 10 seconds.`

**Substitute:**
- Every time you're about to say "sorry" today, replace it with "thank you." ("Thank you for waiting" instead of "Sorry I'm late.") `// Notice how differently it feels.`

**Body:**
- Next time you swallow an honest opinion to keep the peace, notice what your body does. Tight throat? Sinking stomach?

---

### 4. NEED TO CONTROL (The Controller)

**Standard:**
- Let someone do a task their way today — even if you'd do it differently.
- When plans change, don't offer an alternative for 10 minutes. Just sit with it.

**Counter:**
- Count how many times you give instructions that weren't asked for today.

**Timed:**
- Plans just changed. Set a 5-minute timer. Don't fix it, reroute it, or offer solutions until the timer ends.
- Sit for 3 minutes with this thought: "I don't control what happens next." `// Notice the discomfort.`

**Observation:**
- Notice: when someone does something "wrong" (differently than you would), what's the first thing your mind does?
- Pay attention to what happens in your body when someone rearranges your plan.

**Journal:**
- Write about the last time something went wrong because you DIDN'T control it. Now write about the last time something went wrong because you DID.
- What's the worst thing that could happen if you let go of controlling [specific thing]?

**Abstain:**

- Don't open the group chat/project board/email for 2 hours. It'll survive. `// Will you?`

**Scenario:**
- *Your partner/roommate is cooking dinner. They're doing it differently than you would.* → Options: Take over / Offer "helpful" suggestions / Leave the kitchen / Ask if they want help `// Which one is actually about them?`

**Reversal:**
- Let someone else plan your day. Follow their agenda with zero modifications.

**Predict:**
- Predict: if you don't follow up on that delegated task for 24 hours, what will happen? Try it. Then compare.

**Substitute:**
- When you want to give instructions, ask "How are you planning to approach this?" instead.

---

### 5. NEED TO COMPARE (The Scorekeeper)

**Standard:**
- The next time a friend shares good news, respond with genuine enthusiasm. Don't follow up with your own news.
- Go a full day without checking someone else's social media profile to compare your life to theirs.
- Compliment someone on something you're jealous of. `// The discomfort is diagnostic.`
- When someone gets a win today, say "That's great" and leave it there. No "me too." No pivot.

**Counter:**
- Count how many times you mentally compare yourself to someone else today. Just notice the number.
- Track how many times you one-up a story someone tells you.

**Timed:**
- Someone just got the thing you wanted. Sit with the jealousy for 3 minutes without judging it, fixing it, or spinning it. Just feel it.
- Set a 10-minute timer. Scroll social media. Count every comparison thought. Stop when the timer ends.

**Observation:**
- Notice: who do you compare yourself to most? Not celebrities — the specific people in your actual life.
- Pay attention: when you feel good about yourself, is it because something went well for YOU, or because something went wrong for someone else?

**Journal:**
- Write about someone whose success genuinely bothers you. Why them? What do they have that you think you should?
- List 3 things you're proud of that have nothing to do with being better than someone else. `// This might be harder than you think.`

**Scenario:**
- *A colleague just got promoted to the role you wanted.* → Options: Congratulate and move on / Analyze why they got it and you didn't / Assume it's political / Ask yourself what you can learn `// Your first instinct is the data.`

**Abstain:**
- Go one full day without checking any metric: likes, followers, views, rankings, reviews.
- Don't ask anyone about their salary, rent, or job title today.

**Quiz:**
- When a friend announces an achievement, your first internal reaction is usually: (a) Genuinely happy for them (b) Happy for them but immediately compare to yourself (c) Slight deflation (d) "Why not me?" `// All answers are valid. Only honest ones are useful.`

**Body:**
- Next time you see someone's success and feel that pang — where is it? Chest? Stomach? `// Your body knows what jealousy feels like before your mind admits it.`

---

### 6. NEED TO DEFLECT (The Deflector)

**Standard:**
- When someone asks how you're really doing, answer honestly. Not "fine." Not a joke.
- Ask for help with something today. Something you'd normally handle alone. `// This isn't weakness. It's data.`
- In your next serious conversation, resist the urge to make a joke. Stay in it.
- Share one genuine emotion with someone today. Not an opinion. An emotion.

**Counter:**
- Count how many times you use humor to redirect away from something real today.
- Track how many times you change the subject when a conversation gets personal.

**Timed:**
- Someone is being emotionally open with you. Sit in it for 2 minutes without offering advice, deflecting with humor, or changing the subject. Just be there.
- Set a 3-minute timer. Sit with the question: "What am I avoiding feeling right now?"

**Observation:**
- Notice: when a conversation gets real, what's your go-to exit strategy? Humor? A topic change? Intellectualizing?
- Pay attention to what happens right before you crack a joke. What was about to surface?

**Journal:**
- Write about something you're struggling with that nobody in your life knows about. `// You don't have to share it. Just admit it to yourself.`
- Describe your day today — but only the emotional truth. Not what happened. How it felt.

**Abstain:**
- Go through one conversation today without making a single joke or sarcastic comment. `// Notice how exposed you feel.`
- Don't use "I'm fine" or "All good" for a whole day. Give real answers.

**Scenario:**
- *A close friend asks "Is everything okay? You seem off."* → Options: "I'm fine!" / Make a joke / Share what's actually going on / Say "I don't want to talk about it" honestly `// Two of these are deflection. Two are honesty. Which feels scarier?`

**Reversal:**
- Start a conversation by sharing something vulnerable instead of waiting for the other person to go first.

**Substitute:**
- When you want to intellectualize an emotion ("I think the issue is..."), try replacing it with "I feel..."

**Body:**
- When you deflect with humor, freeze for a moment. What sensation were you running from?

---

### 7. NEED TO NARRATE (The Narrator)

**Standard:**
- Go a full conversation without complaining about anything. `// Not suppressing. Just not narrating.`
- The next time you catch yourself rehearsing an argument in your head, stop and take 3 breaths.
- Tell a story about your day that doesn't cast you as the hero or the victim.
- When someone asks "How was your week?", answer without mentioning anything that went wrong.

**Counter:**
- Count how many complaints you make today — out loud or in your head.
- Track how many times you tell the same story to different people this week. `// Repetition is a clue.`

**Timed:**
- Set a 5-minute timer. Try to think about absolutely nothing that happened in the past. Just the present moment. `// The narrator hates silence.`
- You're about to vent about something. Wait 10 minutes. If it still matters, share it once. Then stop.

**Observation:**
- Notice: what percentage of your internal monologue today is about things that already happened?
- Pay attention to how you feel physically WHILE complaining. Energized? Justified? `// That's the high your ego is chasing.`

**Journal:**
- Write about a grievance you've been carrying. Now write it again from the other person's perspective. `// Not to forgive them. To see clearly.`
- Describe your day yesterday without using the words "but," "however," or "unfortunately."

**Abstain:**
- Go from waking up until noon without internally narrating your experience. Just experience it.
- Don't vent to anyone today. Not once.

**Scenario:**
- *Something unfair happened at work. You're about to tell a friend about it.* → Options: Tell the full story / Share just the facts, no editorializing / Don't bring it up / Ask about their day instead `// Which option feels like deprivation?`

**Quiz:**
- When something frustrating happens, you typically: (a) Tell 3+ people about it (b) Replay it in your head for hours (c) Post about it (d) Process it once and move on `// The first three are narrating. The last one is rare.`

**Reversal:**
- Instead of telling someone about a bad experience today, tell them about a good one. Lead with that.

**Predict:**
- Predict: if you go a whole day without complaining, how will you feel by evening? Relieved or agitated? Try it.

**Body:**
- When you're deep in a mental replay of a grievance, notice your jaw, shoulders, and stomach. `// The body holds the story even when the mind lets go.`
