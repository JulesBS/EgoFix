M4 Visual Polish is complete. Here's a summary of what was implemented:

## M4 Visual Polish - Complete

### Phase 1: Boot Sequence
- Created `BootSequenceView.swift` with terminal-style animation
- Green monospaced text appearing line-by-line
- Three animated progress bars for `bugs.db`, `fixes.db`, `patterns.db`
- Blinking cursor at the end
- Integrated into `ContentView.swift` with `hasSeenBoot` persistence

### Phase 2: Scanline & CRT Effect
- Created `ScanlineOverlay.swift` with:
  - Subtle horizontal scanlines (opacity 0.04)
  - Radial vignette (dark corners)
  - `.scanlines()` ViewModifier for easy application
- Applied to main tab view

### Phase 3: Glow Effects
- Action buttons (Apply/Skip/Fail) have colored shadow glow
- Crash button has red glow
- Pattern alert header has severity-colored glow
- Journal and observation text fields glow when focused

### Phase 4: ASCII Art
- Created `BugASCIIArt.swift` with unique 5-8 line ASCII art for each bug:
  - need-to-be-right: exclamation/finger
  - need-to-impress: spotlight/stage
  - need-to-be-liked: mask/mirror
  - need-to-control: grid/ctrl
  - need-to-compare: scale/balance
  - need-to-deflect: shield/bouncing arrow
  - need-to-narrate: speech bubble/mic
- Displayed in bug library rows and detail view headers

### Phase 5: Transitions & Micro-interactions
- Completion view: typing animation for message, outcome color flash
- Crash button: subtle pulse animation (1.0 → 1.05 → 1.0)
- Pattern alert: slide-in from top with shake effect
- Streak counter: tick-up animation with scale pulse

### Phase 6: Typography & Spacing Audit
- Fixed 2 cornerRadius values from 6pt to 4pt in OnboardingView.swift
- All fonts confirmed monospaced
- All corner radii ≤ 4pt

### Phase 7: Tests & Verification
- All 296 tests pass
- Build succeeds with 0 errors

The app now has the brutalist IDE aesthetic described in CLAUDE.md — it feels like terminal software debugging yourself, not a standard dark-mode wellness app.
