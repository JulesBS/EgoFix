M3 Intelligence is complete. Here's a summary of what was accomplished:

## M3 Intelligence - Complete

**All 6 phases completed successfully:**

### Phase 1: Personal Insight Copy
- Verified all 6 detectors already have personal, specific copy with bug names
- PatternDetector protocol and DiagnosticEngine properly pass bug names to detectors
- RecommendationEngine has EgoFix tone ("It happens", "Still running", etc.)

### Phase 2: Detection Pipeline Integration
- Added `lastDiagnosticsRunAt` to UserProfile for scheduling
- DiagnosticEngine.shouldRunDiagnostics() checks 7-day threshold
- TodayViewModel runs diagnostics on launch if overdue and after weekly diagnostic
- BugLifecycleService creates regression DetectedPatterns when bugs regress

### Phase 3: Cooldown & Surfacing Polish
- Added `lastPatternShownAt` to UserProfile for daily limits
- PatternSurfacingService.hasShownPatternToday() prevents overwhelming users
- Combined with sessionPatternShown and 14-day type cooldown
- Observations never interrupt daily flow - only shown in Patterns tab

### Phase 4: Patterns History View Enhancement
- Added filtering by bug with pattern count summary
- Added filtering by severity (ALL/ALERTS/INSIGHTS/OBSERVATIONS)
- Relative time display ("3 days ago" instead of "02/24")
- Status badges: UNREAD (yellow), NOTED (green), DISMISSED (gray)
- Updated empty state: "// No patterns yet. They emerge from data."

### Phase 5: Regression Alerts
- Verified BugLifecycleService creates regression patterns with severity .alert
- Pattern includes bug name in title and crash count in body
- RecommendationEngine has regression-specific recommendations

### Phase 6: Tests & Verification
- Created DiagnosticEngineTests.swift (scheduling, cooldown, priority tests)
- Created RegressionPatternTests.swift (regression pipeline tests)
- All 296 tests pass, project builds with 0 errors
